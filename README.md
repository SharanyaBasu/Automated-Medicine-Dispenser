# PillPal: Automated-Medicine-Dispenser

This is an innovative solution designed to streamline and automate the medication distribution process within long-term care homes. This project addresses the critical need for efficient, error-free drug administration while considering the specific requirements and challenges faced by healthcare professionals.

## Customer
Our target audience includes nurses, personal support workers (PSWs), and administrators in long-term care homes in Ontario. We aim to provide a solution tailored to the demographic, educational, and economic attributes of healthcare professionals working in this sector.

## Problem
The manual process of drug administration in long-term care homes is prone to errors and inefficiencies. PillPal addresses these challenges by automating pill distribution, eliminating the risk of errors, and ensuring timely medication administration.

## Aim
The primary goal of PillPal is to automate the task of pill distribution within long-term care homes. By doing so, we aim to:
- Minimize the chances of medication errors
- Eliminate the possibility of healthcare professionals forgetting to administer drugs
- Alleviate the shortage of nurses and PSWs available for direct patient support

## Existing Solutions
We've analyzed existing solutions in the market, such as Hero and MedMinder, but found them unsuitable for the unique requirements of long-term care homes. PillPal distinguishes itself by specifically catering to the needs of healthcare professionals working in this environment.

## Requirements
PillPal is designed with measurable requirements to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. Key requirements include:
- Alarm sound: ≥70 dB
- Display brightness: ≥40 nits
- Text size: ≥3.79 mm
- Survive 5 drop tests from a 73 cm height
- Dispense each pill in under 1 second, and do so correctly 5/5 times

## Principles
PillPal incorporates fundamental principles such as frequency and harmonics, optics and geometry, circuit laws, pistons, modular arithmetic, and classical mechanics in its design. These principles ensure the robustness and efficiency of the system.

## Design
The design encompasses a functional schematic, hardware specifications, and software specifications. PillPal uses a combination of innovative hardware components and advanced software algorithms to achieve its objectives.

## Costs
Detailed information on manufacturing and implementation costs is provided, covering key components such as the STM32 microcontroller, speaker, LCD screen, servo motor, plastic, and cardboard.

## Risk
The risk analysis section evaluates potential consequences and probabilities related to system use, misuse, and malfunctions. Strategies are outlined to mitigate identified risks.

## Testing
To ensure the reliability and functionality of PillPal, we've defined rigorous testing procedures for key requirements. These include tests for alarm sound, display brightness, text size, drop resistance, and dispense time.
